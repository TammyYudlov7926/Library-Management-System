Library Management System

A structured and extensible C# application for managing books in a library, built as a clean architecture project using multiple software design patterns.

 Key Concepts

This project demonstrates the use of several object-oriented design principles and patterns, including:

- Decorator Pattern – for flexible book enhancements like marking books as "Recommended" or "Library Only".
- Bridge Pattern – to decouple book coloring logic (background/text colors).
- Composite Pattern– for categorizing books into hierarchical structures.
- Adapter Pattern – to standardize book display interfaces.



- Object-Oriented Programming
- Design Patterns

## Project Goals

- Apply classic design patterns in a practical context.
- Learn how to separate concerns and build extensible systems.
- Create a console-based library system that supports various behaviors without modifying core logic.
